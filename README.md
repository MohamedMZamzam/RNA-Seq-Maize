## QC and read mapping in Rice
To perform QC on the rawdata fasq files and remove low qality reads and adaptor sequences etc. Then to mapped the raw reads to reference genome, sort and index the bam file (mapped and unmampped reads)

### Files and datasets
1. Raw data files (SRR1620944.fastq.gz): These are the file from your own experiments or files downloaded from publical repositories like NCBI as in that case
2. The transcript annotation file (Zea_mays.Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0.57.chr.gff3.gz) 
4.  Reference genome index (ZM_mainchrs). This is generated from Zea_mays.Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
